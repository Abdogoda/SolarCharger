					<p>In this project, we use as many sources of renewable energy as possible to generate electricity
						Including the energy of the sun and wind, and we also take advantage of environmental pollution to purify it and convert it into a source of electricity. We have used 18V 50W sun absorbing solar panel and 30W windmill.</p>
						<p>
						The solar panel is characterized by tracking the movement of the sun north, south, east and west. 
						We installed a voltmeter sensor to measure voltage and another sensor for current.
						</p>
						<p>
						We have created a safety circle for payment for shipping, whether charging a car, mobile phone or laptop.
						</p>
						<p>
						You insert the card at the time it is sensed by the RFID circuit. 
						After payment from the visa, the door opens at the location of the charger chosen for the device to be charged, and you charge and when the balance that you entered for you ends, the charging process stops.
						There is a system for booking freight operations and reading about the project, and all of this is in the link below.
						</p><p>
						There are ways other than the sun and the wind from renewable energy sources, which we used aspects of environmental pollution.
						We made a carbon filter in which the reaction produces hydrogen  
						The hydrogen sublimation also helps in producing a hydrogen battery that also generates electricity.
						</p><p>
						There are other sources that we are working on in order to generate electricity, and from them we also clean the environment and protect it from global warming and acid rain.
